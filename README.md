# Musify: Real-Time Cloud DJ Night Platform

## Overview
Musify is a cloud-based, real-time DJ night platform where users can join a virtual club, listen to live DJ mixes with sub-200ms latency, dance together in a 3D environment, and interact via chat and reactions. The platform is designed for scalability, modern UI, and extensibility with AI-driven features.

## MVP Features
- **Real-Time DJ Audio Streaming:**
  - WebRTC SFU (mediasoup) for low-latency, synchronized audio.
  - Centralized cloud deployment for global access.
- **Virtual Dance Floor:**
  - 3D club scene using Three.js or A-Frame.
  - Avatars representing users, with real-time position and animation sync.
- **User Authentication:**
  - Firebase Auth for secure, scalable login (email/social).
- **Real-Time Chat & Reactions:**
  - Socket.io for chat and emoji reactions.
- **Futuristic, Responsive UI:**
  - Built with React.js (TypeScript), modern design, and mobile/desktop support.

## Cloud-Centric Architecture
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express, mediasoup (SFU), Socket.io
- **Frontend:** React.js (TypeScript), mediasoup-client, Three.js/A-Frame
- **Auth/DB:** Firebase Auth + Firestore
- **DevOps:** Docker, NGINX, HTTPS, ready for deployment on AWS/GCP/DigitalOcean
